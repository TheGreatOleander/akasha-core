# AKASHA v2.0

**A sovereign observation engine for time, space, events, networks, state, and voids.**

Akasha observes without authority. It watches what is, what should be, and what isn't there — without telling you what to do.

---

## Philosophy

> **Akasha is free and whole.**  
> **Reflection never stops.**  
> **Optional support maintains sustainability without gating features.**

Akasha is not:
- Predictive policing
- Surveillance AI
- Belief enforcement
- Centralized authority

**Akasha never tells you what to do.** It shows you the shape of what is happening.

---

## The Six Facets

Akasha observes through six lenses:

### 1. ⏱️ TIME — *When things happen*
- Temporal cycles and phases
- Event sequencing
- Delay detection
- **Temporal voids** (things that should have happened but didn't)

### 2. 🗺️ SPACE — *Where things happen*
- Density mapping
- Proximity analysis
- Territorial boundaries
- **Spatial voids** (places where activity should exist but doesn't)

### 3. ⚡ EVENT — *What happens*
- Event typing and weighting
- Pattern clustering
- Cross-domain correlation
- Anomaly detection

### 4. 🕸️ NETWORK — *Who/what is connected*
- Entity relationships
- Flow analysis
- Centrality calculation
- **Network voids** (missing connections, isolated nodes)

### 5. 📊 STATE — *How things are*
- Stability assessment
- Transition detection
- Phase analysis
- Load measurement

### 6. 🕳️ VOID — *What is missing*
- Absence detection
- Expected vs actual comparison
- Silence monitoring
- Gap identification

## What Makes Akasha Different

Most systems watch **presence**.  
Akasha watches **absence**.

**The void is often louder than the signal.**

## Quick Start

**Try it now:** [Live Demo](https://thegreatoleander.github.io/akasha-core/) *(coming soon)*

Or run locally:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Start observing

That's it. Akasha runs entirely in your browser. No installation, no server, no accounts.

## Usage

### Ingesting Observations

Add observations with:
- **Type** — what kind of event
- **Entity** — who/what is involved
- **Location** — where it happened (x,y coordinates)
- **State** — current condition
- **Notes** — additional context

### Viewing Facets

- Toggle lenses on the left to activate different observation facets
- Click facet tabs to see detailed projections
- Combine multiple lenses to see multi-dimensional patterns

### Understanding Voids

Akasha automatically detects:
- **Temporal voids** — gaps in time where events should have occurred
- **Spatial voids** — locations with unexpected absence of activity
- **Network voids** — entities with missing or broken connections
- **State voids** — systems that have gone silent

---

## For Researchers

Akasha is designed for academic and research use:

- ✅ **Open source** (MIT licensed)
- ✅ **Local-first** (no data sent to servers)
- ✅ **Extensible** (build custom facets)
- ✅ **Non-predictive** (observation only, no forecasting)
- ✅ **Ethically neutral** (no embedded values or goals)

### Research Applications

- Complex systems analysis
- Urban planning and infrastructure monitoring
- Network security and anomaly detection
- Healthcare pattern detection
- Environmental monitoring
- Social dynamics observation
- Any domain requiring non-agentic witnessing

---

## For Developers

### Building Custom Facets

Akasha's facet system is modular. Each facet analyzes observations through a specific lens and detects voids within that dimension.

### Building Akasha Apps

Akasha Core is the foundation. Build domain-specific apps on top:

1. Import the `AkashaCore` engine
2. Configure for your domain
3. Add domain-specific UI
4. Deploy as standalone app

**Note:** Akasha Core is MIT licensed (free forever). Apps you build can use any license you choose.

---

## Architecture

### Core Engine (`AkashaCore`)

The invariant observation substrate. Never changes. All facets operate through this engine.

**Key Methods:**
- `ingest(observation)` — Add new observation
- `project(lensStack)` — View through selected facets
- `detectVoids()` — Find absences and gaps
- `query(filters)` — Search observations

### Facet Analyzers

Each facet has dedicated analysis:
- `analyzeTime()` — Temporal patterns and cycles
- `analyzeSpace()` — Spatial distributions and density
- `analyzeEvent()` — Event correlations and clusters
- `analyzeNetwork()` — Connection graphs and flow
- `analyzeState()` — State transitions and stability
- `analyzeVoid()` — Absence detection across all dimensions

---

## Philosophy Deep Dive

### Why "Observation Without Agency"?

Most systems conflate observation with action:
- They see, then recommend
- They detect, then predict
- They measure, then optimize

Akasha separates these:
- It sees, then shows you
- It detects, then records
- It measures, then maps

**You are the authority.** Akasha is the instrument.

### The Primacy of the Void

Reality is as much about what *isn't* as what *is*:
- The crime that didn't happen
- The connection that broke
- The signal that went silent
- The event that was delayed

Traditional systems ignore absence because it's hard to represent. Akasha makes voids first-class entities.

### Non-Teleological Computing

Akasha has no goal. It doesn't want anything. It doesn't optimize for anything.

It simply watches.

This is rare in software. Most systems are purpose-built. Akasha is purpose-neutral.
