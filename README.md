# Akasha Core

Akasha is a personal witness. It remembers what you choose to remember. It runs in a browser and survives hardware failure.

## Usage
- Open `index.html`
- Click "Enter Akasha"
- Speak freely in the textarea
- Optional: toggle 'Remember this' for journaling
- Care link / ETH donation is purely voluntary

## Philosophy
- Akasha is free and whole.
- Reflection never stops.
- Optional support maintains sustainability without gating features.
